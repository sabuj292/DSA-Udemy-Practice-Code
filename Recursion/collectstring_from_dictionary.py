'''
The collectStrings function takes a single argument, obj, which is expected to be a dictionary.

It initializes an empty list called resultArr to store the collected strings.

The function iterates over the keys of the input dictionary obj using a for loop.

For each key, it checks if the corresponding value is a string using the type() function. If it's a string, the value is appended to the resultArr list.

If the value associated with a key is itself a dictionary, the function recursively calls itself with that sub-dictionary (collectStrings(obj[key]), which continues the process of searching for string values within nested dictionaries.

Finally, the function returns the resultArr list, which contains all the string values found in the dictionary and its nested sub-dictionaries.
